# All about $STAR

$STAR is an over-collateralized stablecoin backed by a 110% minimum collateral ratio. Loans are secured by always having more value locked than the amount of debt given out.

Preon introduced a linear fee model in the minting process.

Users do not pay the 8% borrow fee upfront. The fees are split & paid linearly over 6 months.

Disclaimer: These fees are subject to change in the future due to market conditions and/or other factors.
